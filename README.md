Scripts for publication: Bumblebee Pollination and Herbivory Alter Genomic Adaptation of Plants to Soil, Molecular Ecology 2025

We used genomic and phenotypic data to better understand how ecological factors affect genomic divergence between three factors: soil, herbivory, and pollination.
More specifically, we run genetic PCAs, Fst pairwise tests, selection scans, genome-wide association scans with phenotypic traits, candidate gene associations, and build pleiotropic networks.  

Description of the data and file structure
These scripts will recreate the analyses shown in the publication. The heading numbers are based on the material methods section. Within the folders, scripts are structured numerically. Thus, 1_ is first, 2_ is second, and so on. You may need to change the working directory to rerun the scripts.
