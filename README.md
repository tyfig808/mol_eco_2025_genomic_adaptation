## Summary
We used genomic and phenotypic data to better understand how ecological factors affect genomic divergence between three factors: soil, herbivory, and pollination.
More specifically, we run genetic PCAs, Fst pairwise tests, selection scans, genome-wide association scans with phenotypic traits, candidate gene associations, and build pleiotropic networks.
